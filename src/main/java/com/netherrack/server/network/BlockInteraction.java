/**
 * Players breaking, placing and using blocks.
 * <p>
 * All are predicted by the client: it shows the change straight away and tells the server
 * what it did. The server checks it's allowed, applies it to the world (by the rules in
 * BlockPlacement, BlockBreaking and BlockUse) and shows everyone who can see it - or, when
 * it isn't allowed, tells the client what's really there so its prediction is undone.
 * <p>
 * Breaking in survival is timed by the client (StartGame turns on server-authoritative
 * block breaking, so the client reports each stage in PlayerAuthInput). The cracks, the
 * break particles and the sounds of placing and using blocks are the server's to show
 * though - to everyone, the player included, whose client leaves them to the server in
 * this mode. A block broken in survival drops what it drops for what the player holds.
 * Placing uses the block item the player holds, one of which is used up; a bed, banner or
 * head keeps what its item says of its looks - a color, patterns - in a block entity.
 * <p>
 * In creative, the first hit breaks a block and nothing drops, and placing uses nothing up.
 * Visitors, and players in adventure or spectator mode, may not build - their clients are
 * told so, but the server checks too, since a client can't be trusted to.
 * <p>
 * There's one of these per player, since it keeps track of the block they're breaking.
